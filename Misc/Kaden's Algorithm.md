**Kadane's Algorithm** is a dynamic programming technique used to solve the maximum subarray problem - finding the contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional array of numbers that has the largest sum. Named after its inventor **Jay Kadane**, who introduced it in 1984, this elegant algorithm is renowned for its simplicity and efficiency.[geeksforgeeks+2](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/largest-sum-contiguous-subarray/)

## Core Concept

The algorithm addresses a fundamental problem: given an array of integers (which may include negative numbers), find the contiguous subarray with the maximum possible sum. A subarray is defined as a continuous part of an array, and the algorithm must consider at least one element.[geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/largest-sum-contiguous-subarray/)

## How Kadane's Algorithm Works

## The Key Insight

The fundamental insight behind Kadane's algorithm is to **traverse the array from left to right and, for each element, find the maximum sum among all subarrays ending at that element**. The algorithm maintains two critical variables: [geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/largest-sum-contiguous-subarray/)

- **`max_ending_here`**: The maximum sum of a subarray ending at the current position
- **`max_so_far`**: The overall maximum subarray sum found so far [simplilearn+1](https://www.simplilearn.com/kadanes-algorithm-article)

## Decision Making Process
At each position in the array, the algorithm makes a crucial decision between two choices:[geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/largest-sum-contiguous-subarray/)
1. **Extend the existing subarray**: Add the current element to the maximum subarray ending at the previous position (if beneficial)
2. **Start a new subarray**: Begin fresh from the current element (if the previous sum is negative)
This translates to the formula: **`max_ending_here = max(arr[i], max_ending_here + arr[i])`**.[wikipedia+1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_subarray_problem)

## Step-by-Step Algorithm

Here's how Kadane's algorithm processes an array:[preplaced+1](https://www.preplaced.in/blog/understanding-kadanes-algorithm)
1. **Initialize** two variables:
    - `max_so_far` = first element (or negative infinity for all-negative arrays)
    - `max_ending_here` = 0
2. **Iterate** through each element in the array:
    - Update `max_ending_here` as the maximum of the current element or the sum of current element and previous `max_ending_here`
    - Update `max_so_far` as the maximum of current `max_so_far` and `max_ending_here`
    - If `max_ending_here` becomes negative, reset it to 0
3. **Return** `max_so_far` as the maximum subarray sum

## Detailed Example

Let's trace through the algorithm with the array `[1, -3, 2, 1]`:[preplaced](https://www.preplaced.in/blog/understanding-kadanes-algorithm)

- **Element 1**: `max_ending_here = 1`, `max_so_far = 1`
- **Element -3**: `max_ending_here = -2` (1 + (-3)), but since it's negative, reset to 0; `max_so_far = 1`
- **Element 2**: `max_ending_here = 2`, `max_so_far = 2` (updated)
- **Element 1**: `max_ending_here = 3` (2 + 1), `max_so_far = 3` (updated)

The maximum subarray sum is **3**, corresponding to the subarray ``.[takeuforward+2](https://takeuforward.org/data-structure/kadanes-algorithm-maximum-subarray-sum-in-an-array/)

## Algorithm Complexity

Kadane's algorithm is highly efficient with:[simplilearn+1](https://www.simplilearn.com/kadanes-algorithm-article)
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) - single pass through the array
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) - constant extra space

This linear time complexity makes it significantly faster than naive approaches that require O(n²) or O(n³) time.[simplilearn](https://www.simplilearn.com/kadanes-algorithm-article)
## Implementation Considerations

## Handling All-Negative Arrays

The standard version handles arrays with all negative numbers by returning the least negative number. Some implementations initialize `max_so_far` to the first element rather than zero to handle this case properly.[wikipedia+1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_subarray_problem)

## Tracking Subarray Indices

The basic algorithm only returns the maximum sum. **To track the actual subarray positions**, additional variables can be maintained to store the start and end indices of the optimal subarray.[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_subarray_problem)

## Dynamic Programming Foundation

Kadane's algorithm exemplifies **dynamic programming principles** because it uses optimal substructures - the maximum subarray ending at each position is calculated efficiently from the related subproblem at the previous position. This overlapping subproblem structure makes it a classic example of dynamic programming in action.[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_subarray_problem)

## Variations and Extensions

The algorithm can be extended to higher dimensions, such as **3D Kadane's algorithm** for finding maximum sum sub-cubes in three-dimensional arrays, though these variations have higher time complexity (O(n⁴) for 3D).[geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/3d-kadanes-algorithm/)

Kadane's algorithm represents an elegant solution that transforms a potentially complex optimization problem into a simple, linear-time algorithm through clever use of dynamic programming principles.
