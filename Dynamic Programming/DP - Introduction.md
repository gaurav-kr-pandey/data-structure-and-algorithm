## üß† **Dynamic Programming (DP) - Beginner Notes**

---

### üìå 1. **What is Dynamic Programming?**

Dynamic Programming is a method for solving **complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems**, solving each subproblem only once, and storing their results (memoization or tabulation).

#### üîÅ Core Idea:

> Avoid recalculating the same subproblem multiple times.

### üß± 2. **Foundations You Should Know**

- **Recursion**
    
- **Backtracking (optional but helpful)**
    
- **Understanding Call Stack**
    
- **Basic Memoization with HashMaps or Arrays**
    
- **Greedy vs. DP thinking**

### üß© 3. **Key Concepts in DP**

|Concept|Description|
|---|---|
|**Overlapping Subproblems**|The same subproblem is solved multiple times.|
|**Optimal Substructure**|The optimal solution of the problem depends on the optimal solution of its subproblems.|
|**Memoization (Top-Down)**|Recursion + Caching (usually with `dp[]` array or map).|
|**Tabulation (Bottom-Up)**|Iteratively solving subproblems and building the solution.|
|**State Definition**|What parameters uniquely define the subproblem?|
|**Transition Relation**|How do we build a solution from smaller subproblems?|

### ‚öôÔ∏è 4. **Steps to Solve a DP Problem**

1. **Identify if DP can be applied**
    
    - Are there **overlapping subproblems**?
        
    - Is there **optimal substructure**?
        
2. **Define the state**
    
    - `dp[i]` might represent the answer for the subproblem involving the first `i` elements, or reaching index `i`, etc.
        
3. **Write the recurrence relation**
    
    - Eg: `dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]` for Fibonacci
        
4. **Initialize the base cases**
    
    - Eg: `dp[0] = 0`, `dp[1] = 1` for Fibonacci
        
5. **Implement with memoization or tabulation**
    
    - Decide based on problem type or constraints.

### üîÅ 5. **Memoization vs Tabulation**

|Feature|Memoization (Top-Down)|Tabulation (Bottom-Up)|
|---|---|---|
|Approach|Recursive|Iterative|
|Space|May use call stack|Usually flat array|
|Readability|Easier for beginners|More optimized|
|Use When|You think recursively|You want to avoid recursion depth|

### üõ†Ô∏è 8. **Practice Strategy**

- Start with 1D problems (Fibonacci, Climbing Stairs)
    
- Move to 2D problems (LCS, Knapsack)
    
- Understand space optimization
    
- Use both memoization and tabulation
    
- Write recurrence first, then build code

### ‚úÖ 9. **Tips**

- **Draw recursion tree**
    
- **Try brute-force first**, then optimize
    
- **Name your dp[] meaningfully**
    
- **Dry run with small input**
    
- **Focus more on recurrence logic than just syntax**
